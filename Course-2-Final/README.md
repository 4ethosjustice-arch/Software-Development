# MiniClueGameGUI

## A mini clue game where you can modify the code to add more weapons rooms and characters complete with objects and a GUI using javafx

## I built this as a project that shows my abilities 

## You can run this by compiling with a jave compiler and then having java fx downloaded you can run the program

## Example of code
```
public boolean matches(Suspect s, Weapon w, Room r) {
        return suspect.getName().equalsIgnoreCase(s.getName()) &&
               weapon.getName().equalsIgnoreCase(w.getName()) &&
               room.getName().equalsIgnoreCase(r.getName());
```
